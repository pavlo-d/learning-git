Ooohe, ooh
Ooohe, ooh
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
I want to hear your breath just next to my soul
I want to feel oppress without any rest
I want to see you sing
I want to see you fight
Because you are the real beauty of human right
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
Ooohe, Makeba, Makeba ma qué bella
Can I get a "oohe?" Makeba
Makes my body dance for you
